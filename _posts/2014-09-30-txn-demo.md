Today we learn how bitcoin transactions are made.  Transactions are the heart of bitcoin, and learning about their inner workings illuminates many of the mysteries and complexities of the rest of the bitcoin system.  There are several different types of transactions, but I'll limit my explanation to the most common type of transaction called "pay to pubkey hash", which is a fancy way of describing the normal peer to peer transactions which everyone knows and loves.

# The In's and Out's of Transactions

Bitcoin transactions are a bit like bank checks.  Bank checks display a bank account number, which reveals where the about-to-be-transferred funds come from, they have a "payee" field, which identifies the recipient of the transferred funds, and they have a signature, which serves to proove that the owner of the account authorized the transfer of funds. 

Bitcoin transactions are composed of 2 lists:

* a list of "outputs", each output says:
  - how much bitcoin is transferred
  - who recevies the bitcoin transfer
* a list of "inputs", each input includes:
  - a reference to a past output
  - a "signature" which proves the transaction creator is authorized to spend that output

It's important to understand that <b>the inputs of new transactions are references to the outputs of old transactions</b>.  As part of the bitcoin mining process, new outputs are created "out of nothing". These outputs are then "spent" when they are referenced as inputs to new transactions, each of which creates a new list of outputs, and the cycle continues.

Let's go through an example:

<div>
  In transaction 89:
  <ul class="no-list">
    <li>Alice pays 3 BTC to Bob</li>
    <li>Alice pays 2 BTC to Alice</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  In transaction 92:
  <ul class="no-list">
    <li>Carol pays 4 BTC to Bob</li>
    <li>Carol pays 1 BTC to Carol</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  In transaction 114:
  <ul class="no-list">
    <li>Dave pays 7 BTC to Bob</li>
    <li>Dave pays 2 BTC to Dave</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Now, let's say Bob wishes to pay Frank 12 BTC.  He creates the following:

<div>
  Inputs:
  <ul class="no-list">
    <li>3 BTC from transaction 89</li>
    <li>4 BTC from transaction 92</li>
    <li>7 BTC from transaction 114</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  Outputs:
  <ul class="no-list">
    <li>12 BTC to Frank</li>
    <li>1.95 to Bob</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Change must be given in these transactions if the sum of the inputs is greater than the amount being sent to the recipient.  After adding the "change" output, i the sum of the inputs is greater than the sum of the outputs, the remainder is collected by the miner who confirms your transaction, which is called the "fee". Naturally, the sum of all bitcoins in the inputs must be greater than or equal to the sum of all bitcoins in the outputs, or else your transaction will get rejected.

# Outputs

Beware: the following examples show hex digits.  Because all data on computers is a series of 1's and 0's, hex lets us conveniently talk about those 1's and 0's without actually printing all the 1's and 0's, is hard to read.

<h1>Locks</h1>

<p>
We've established that outputs are used to transfer funds from an old owner to a new owner, and that the new owner uses these outputs as inputs into new transactions.  Given that the details of all outputs are public, how do we ensure that only the intended recipient can use the output, and nobody else?
</p>

<p>
When outputs are created, they come with a "locking script".  This locking script is essentially a mathematical equation with the promise that anyone who can successfully solve the mathematical equation is authorized to spend the funds associated with this output.  An input provides the answer to that mathematical equation in an "unlocking script" when it references the output.  Before processing transactions, miners check to ensure that an input's unlocking script successfully solves the referenced output's locking script.  Technically, to verify if an "unlocking script" correctly unlocks a "locking" script, we join both scripts together, and determine whether the resulting expression is true or false.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<ul class="no-list">
<li>Locking Script: "=7"</li>
<li>Unlocking Script: "3+4"</li>
<li>Because 3+4=7, the unlocking script "3+4" successfully unlocks the "=7" locking script.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is the general mechanic of bitcoin scripts, but instead of mathematical operators, bitcoin uses it's own scripting language which defines several operations helpful for making locking and unlocking scripts.
</p>

<p>
To recap, the bitcoin system has:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>private keys: random numbers</li>
  <li>public keys: based on private keys, and used to verify signatures</li>
  <li>addresses: hash of the public key, used as an address to send funds</li>
</ul>

<p>
Also remember that private keys and public keys interact with each other in the following way:
</p>
<ul class="no-list">
<li>"message" + private key = signature</li>
<li>"message" + signature + public key = true/false</li>
</ul>

<p>
The locking script, "OP_DUP OP_HASH160 `` key.addr_dec `` OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG", requires the following from an unlocking script:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Unlocking script must provide a signature and public key which evaluates to "true" for a given message.</li>
  <li>The hash of the public key from the unlocking script must match the bitcoin address in the locking script.</li>
</ol>
  
<p>
Both conditions must be met in an unlocking script for this output to successfully be used as an input in a new transaction.  One must provide a signature and a public key in the resultant unlocking script.
</p>

<h1>Creating a new Transaction</h1>

<p>We'll be creating a transaction that has 1 input and 2 outputs.</p> 
<ul class="no-list">
  <li>Input = the output which we meticulously dissected above; <span>`` (output.spend ? toBtc(getSatoshi(output.spend)) : "N/A ") + "BTC from transaction " + utxo.hash ``</span></li>
  <li>Output 1 = a bitcoin transfer to another address</li>
  <li>Output 2 = 'change' which goes back to our own address.</li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulation, we have just created our very own transaction!  Because this is real bitcoin, I've already spent the output referenced by in the input in this transaction, so the above transaction will be rejected as an attempted double spend.
