title: About Royal Fork
---

A "royal fork" is a chess tactic where a single piece attacks the opponent's king and queen simultaneously.

(Pictured: Continuation from Round 10, Petrosian - Spassky World Championship Match (1966)[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1106725])

It's rather poetic.  We have the king; the most important piece in the game and one which must be protected at all costs; and the queen; a piece whose power exceeds that of the next 2 most powerful pieces combined.  In the above position, the almighty king and dominant queen both find themselves unescapably ensnared by a single, lowly, well positioned knight.  The royal fork reminds us that it doesn't take an army to push around 2 towering, seemingly unassailable pieces.....just an idea and stellar execution.

I think this serves as a decent metaphor for bitcoin.  Like the knight, Bitcoin has positioned itself squarely between 2 giant institutions of the State, which regulates the monetary system, and the federal Banking system, which executes the monetary system.  Unlike the chess analogy, I don't think the relationship between Bitcoin, States, and Banks is or should ever be adversarial.  Chess has clear winners and losers; the real world is much less .

I'm a programmer by trade, but have always been interested in banking, economics, and politics.  Bitcoin is *the* intersection of all the things I love and am passionate about.  This blog will follow my personal journey as I learn more about Bitcoin, in all it's facets.

In the next months, I hope to cover:

- Deep technical dive into the core protocol (make your own wallet software, broadcast transcations, navigate the blockchain, program contracts, etc.)

- Describe our current monetary system  (investigate the relationship between banks and government, compare monetary policies of different nation states, define the money supply and describe how it works, etc)

- History of Money (how did our monetary policy evolved to where it is today?, what lessons can we learn from both good and bad monetary policy?, etc.)

- Game Theory and Bitcoin (what scenarios are good for bitcoin, how to go mainstream, economics of bitcoin mining)
