In preparation for this post, I've read several research papers, a book, listened to 4 university lectures, idled away hours on IRC, developed elliptic curve libraries in 2 seperate languages, and built my own elliptic curve graphing framework.  Elliptic curve cryuptography is hard.  As one of the fundamental crypto systems making Bitcoin a "crypto"-currency, I really wanted to understand the underlying technical aspects which make this form of cryptography secure.  This post is an attempt to demystify the elliptic curve digital signing algorithm which underlies bitcoin's psuedoanonymous identity system.

# Explain like I'm young but just a little older than 5

Imagine a classroom of elementary school children who know multiplication but have not yet learned division.  At the beginning of the year, the teacher proclaims "My special number is 5".  One morning, the message "Twas always thus and always thus will be" -- signed "Teacher - 8" appears on the chalkboard.  How do the students know this message came from the teacher and not some movie-quote-loving fraudster?  They multiply the teacher's "special number" - 5 - by the "signature number" - 8 - and if they get the number of characters in the message (40 character message), they deem the signature valid, and are confidant that the message did indeed come from the teacher.  Oblivious to the magic of division, students are unable to produce a valid signature for any arbitrary message, and because the signature is based on the length of the message, the students can't serruptitously change the message. 

This is how the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm works; the "knower" of the private key is endowed with the power of division, while public key holders can only use multiplication to check whether signaturees are valid.

# Why does Bitcoin need digital signatures?

Alice sends 2 bitcoins to Bob's public bitcoin address (1Bob4ddr355).  If Bob sends these 2 bitcoins to Charley (1CharAdresS), he broadcasts a message stating "1Bob4ddr355 sends 2 BTC to 1CharAddreS".  The Bitcoin system must ensure that Bob and only Bob can broadcast this message; if anyone else is able to broadcast this message, or alter it in anyway, Bitcoin breaks irreparably.

# Public Key Cryptography to the Rescue

Bob needs:

*  a private key - sequence of numbers that only Bob knows
*  a public key - another sequence of numbers that Bob can share with anyone
*  a message to be signed

A digital signature system must have the following algorithms:

* To sign:
  * <span style="color:#a12">"This is a message"</span> + <span style="color:#15a">Private Key<sub>Bob</sub></span> = <span style="color:#629">Signature<sub>&nbsp;"This is a message", Bob</sub></span>

* To verify:
  * <span style="color:#a12">"This is a message"</span> + <span style="color:#629">Signature<sub>&nbsp;"This is a message", Bob</sub></span> + <span style="color:#59d">Public Key<sub>Bob</sub></span> = <span style="color:green">True</span>
  * <span style="color:red">"Another message"</span> + <span style="color:#629">Signature<sub>&nbsp;"This is a message", Bob</sub></span> + <span style="color:#59d">Public Key<sub>Bob</sub></span> = <span style="color:red">False</span>
  * <span style="color:#a12">"This is a message"</span> + <span style="color:red">Signature<sub>&nbsp;"This is a message", Chuck</sub></span> + <span style="color:#59d">Public Key<sub>Bob</sub></span> = <span style="color:red">False</span>
  * <span style="color:#a12">"This is a message"</span> + <span style="color:red">Signature<sub>&nbsp;"Another message", Bob</sub></span> + <span style="color:#59d">Public Key<sub>Bob</sub></span> = <span style="color:red">False</span>
  * <span style="color:#a12">"This is a message"</span> + <span style="color:#629">Signature<sub>&nbsp;"This is a message", Bob</sub></span> + <span style="color:red">Public Key<sub>Chuck</sub></span> = <span style="color:red">False</span>

Because it's impossible to create <span style="color:#629">Signature<sub>&nbsp;"This is a message", Bob</sub></span> without Bob's private key, we can be certain that Bob and only Bob digitally signed a message when his public key verifies a signature.

Several mathematical techniques can be used to build such a system, but the current "cutting edge" technology in terms of efficiency and security is elliptic curve cryptography.

# What are Elliptic Curves?

Not to be confused with an "ellipse," elliptic curves look like:


<div class="ec-big-container plot-container">
  <div id="empty-ec" class="plot-placeholder" style="width:450px;height:450px"></div>
  <div class="ec-info">
    <p>The general equation for elliptic curves is:
    $$y^2 = x^3 + a*x + b$$
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 20px">This specific elliptic curve has equation:
    $$y^2 = x^3 - 3*x + 4$$
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 20px">All elliptic curves are symmetric about the x-axis.</p>
  </div>
</div>

We need the ability to add 2 points on this curve; which works as follows.

<div class="ec-big-container plot-container">
  <div id="ec-addition" class="plot-placeholder" style="width:450px;height:450px"></div>
  <div class="ec-info">
    <p>To add 2 points (<span class="point-a">Point A</span>, and <span class="point-b">Point B</span>)
    <ol>
      <li>Draw a line between <span class="point-a">Point A</span> and <span class="point-b">Point B</span></li>
      <li>This line always intersects the elliptic curve at a 3rd point.</li>
      <li>Reflect the the observed intersection point over the x axis to get the <span class="sum">sum of Point A and Point B</span></li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <div class="ec-formula">
      <span class="point-a">(-2.0, 1.4)</span> + <span class="point-b point-b-add">(&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;)</span> = <span class="sum sum-add">(&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;)</span>
    </div>
    <p><i>This graph is interactive, click on the curve to compute different sums.</i></p>
  </div>
</div>

What happens if we want to add a point to itself?  We can't draw a line between a point and itself, so we slightly modify the above operation.

<div class="ec-big-container plot-container">
  <div id="ec-double" class="plot-placeholder" style="width:450px;height:450px"></div>
  <div class="ec-info">
    <p>To double a point (<span class="point-a">Point A</span> + <span class="point-a">Point A</span>)
    <ol>
      <li>Draw a line tangent to the elliptic curve through <span class="point-a">Point A</span></li>
      <li>This line always intersects the elliptic curve at a 2nd point.</li>
      <li>Reflect the the observed intersection point over the x axis to get <span class="sum">2 * Point A</span></li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <div class="ec-formula">
      2 * <span class="point-a point-a-double">(&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;)</span> = <span class="sum sum-double">(&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;)</span>
    </div>
    <p><i>The graph is interactive, click on the curve to compute a different double.</i></p>
  </div>
</div>

Using a bit of algebra and calculus, we can derive the following equations to easily add or double points without the necessity of graphs. This is included for the curious; knowing that these calculations are extremely easy is more important than knowing the actual equations.

<div class="ec-equations">
  <p>Given $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$: to find $(x_3, y_3) = (x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_2)$</p>
  <div style="margin-left: 60px">
    <div style="display:inline-block">
      <p>
        $x_3 = s^2 - x_1 - x_2$
      </p>
      <p>$y_3 = s(x_1 - x_3) - y_1$</p>
    </div>

    <div style="display:inline-block;margin:20px 40px">
      $$s =
      \begin{cases}
      \frac {y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1},  & \text{if $(x_1, y_1) \neq (x_2, y_2)$} \\
      \frac {3x^2 + a}{2y_1}, & \text{if $(x_1, y_1) = (x_2, y_2)$}
      \end{cases}$$
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

A problem

As can be seen in the preceeding calculations, decimals are all over the place.  Computers hate decimal places.  Some decimals are irrational (meaning they go on for ever...like 1.4142135623...), and computers don't have the infinite space require to store all these digits.  They can make approximations, but when rounding produces equations that ask if 5.9999999 = 6, what's the computer to do?  Similarly, computers can't compute on truly gargantuam numbers either (numbers with hundreds of digits are ok, but when numbers have thousands or millions of digits, we run into problems).

The relatively esoteric mathematic concepts of "finite fields" and "modular arithmetic" help us solve these problems.  

If you can tell time, you already understand *some* modular arithmetic.  If it's 21:00 (9:00pm), and you must feed your cat in 11 hours, you will be feeding your cat at 8:00; not 32:00.  The clock resets at 24:00 back to 0:00.  We use this same technique (called "taking the modulus") in our elliptic curve equations to prohibit numbers from getting too large; we set an upper limit on how big numbers get and reset them back to 0 when they exceed that limit.

Unfortunately, we still have our decimal problem (21.593 hours + 11 hours is still 8.593 hours).  Observing that the "division" and "square root" operations are the ones which actually cause the decimals; we'll just redefine those operations to give us non-decimal answers!  This sounds a bit like cheating, but because the math works out, it's ok.

The expression "12 mod 9 = 3" means that 12 becomes 3 when our upper limit is 9.

So:

(4 + 7) mod 9 = 2

(4 - 7) mod 9 = 6 (negative numbers "wrap around" the opposite way)

(4 * 7) mod 9 = 1

(4 / 7) mod 9 = ? --- remember, we don't want decimal places

(4 / 7) mod 9 = (4 * 1/7) mod 9

The trick:
7 * 1/7 = 1
(7 * 4) mod 9 = 1

Because division is nothin more than a multiplicative inverse, modular arithmetic lets up replace 1/7 with 4.  Substituting the above equation:
  (4 * 4) mod 9 = 7

Taking a similiar approach with square roots (sqrt(7) mod 9 = 4, because 4^2 mod 9 = 7), we've now have a way to completely eradicate decimals, big numbers, and negative numbers from our calculations; making our computer very happy.

# Elliptic Curves over Finite Fields

An elliptic curve with modulus 29 (upper limit is 29) looks like:

<div class="plot-container">
  <div id="ff-points" class="plot-placeholder" style="width:450px;height:450px"></div>
</div>

Some peculiar things that you might notice:
  - the graph is symmetric about the line x = 14.5.  Like our continuous graphs, each point has a friend on the same x coordinate.
  - Not every x coordinate has a point (look at x = 10....there are no points)

This last property is particularly interesting, and raises the question, how exactly was this graph made?  We start with a point that is known to be in the finite field, on the elliptic curve (0,2), and set that as our generator point.  We then enumerate all multiple of this generator point.
  1 * G = (0, 2)
  2 * G = (6, 17)
  3 * G = (22, 1)
  4 * G = (23, 3)
  5 * G = (2, 8)
  6 * G = (7, 6)
  7 * G = (17, 9)
  8 * G = (21, 3)
  9 * G = (13, 25)
  10 * G = (3, 15)
  11 * G = (19, 22)
  12 * G = (14, 26)
  13 * G = (28, 8)
  14 * G = (8, 17)
  15 * G = (15, 17)
  16 * G = (15, 12)
  17 * G = (8, 12)
  18 * G = (28, 21)
  19 * G = (14, 3)
  20 * G = (19, 7)
  21 * G = (3, 14)
  22 * G = (13, 4)
  23 * G = (21, 26)
  24 * G = (17, 20)
  25 * G = (7, 23)
  26 * G = (2, 21)
  27 * G = (23, 26)
  28 * G = (22, 28)
  29 * G = (6, 12)
  30 * G = (0, 27)
  31 * G = Infinity (remember, if we add 2 points that are on the same x coordinate, we get infinity)

This then cycles back around: 32 * G = 1 * G = (0,2), 33 * G = 2 * G = (6, 17), etc.

We're only able to do this because we have a very small number of elements.  When using a much bigger modulus, creating a "full graph" of all points is impossible.

To demonstrate that we can still perform our elliptic curve functions on a finite field, we have point doubling:

<div class="ec-big-container plot-container">
  <div id="ff-double" class="plot-placeholder" style="width:450px;height:450px"></div>
  <div class="ec-info">
    <p>Applying the same technique from above, with a modulus for the intersection line:</p>
    <div class="ec-formula">
      2 * <span class="point-a point-a-ffdouble">(&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;)</span> = <span class="sum sum-ffdouble">(&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;)</span>
    </div>
    <p>Looking at our table of points above, we can verify that:</p>
      <p><span class="point-a point-a-ffdouble">(&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;)</span> = <span class="point-a point-a-ffdouble-multiplier"></span> * G</p>
    <p>and the doubled point:</p>
      <p><span class="sum sum-ffdouble">(&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;)</span> = <span class="sum sum-ffdouble-multiplier"></span> * G</p>
    
    <p>As we can see, doubling the generator doubles the point: 2 * <span class="point-a point-a-ffdouble-multiplier"></span> mod 31 = <span class="sum sum-ffdouble-multiplier"></span></p>

    <p>The graph is interactive, click on the curve to compute a different double.</p>
  </div>
</div>

The Key to Elliptic Curves

To summarize the above, we have operations that let us do the following:
  Point A + Point B = Point C
  2 * Point A = Point D

Let's say we want to figure out 9 * Point A....how might we do that?
  One way to do this:
    2 * Point A  = Point 2A
    Point 2A + Point A  = Point 3A
    Point 3A + Point A  = Point 4A
    Point 4A + Point A  = Point 5A
    Point 5A + Point A  = Point 6A
    Point 6A + Point A  = Point 7A
    Point 7A + Point A  = Point 8A
    Point 8A + Point A  = Point 9A ... our answer.

  An easier way: (called the "divide and conquer method")
    2 * Point A  = Point 2A
    2 * Point 2A = Point 4A
    2 * Point 4A = Point 8A
    Point 8A + Point A = Point 9A ... our answer.

Using the divide and conquer method, we compute the product in only 4 steps, instead of the expected 9.  This trick is really important in making elliptic curve cryptography secure.  Since elliptic curves don't have a divide method, it's *really hard* to determine what factor was used to arrive at a specific point.

  Example:
  Let's say I wish to compute: 314159265 * (0,2)
  Using the divide and conquer method, I perform X operations, and arrive at (X, Y)
  If I tell you the starting point (0,2) and the ending point (X,Y), you would have to perform all 314159265 operations before you know which factor I used in my calculation.

This trick is the basis of the public key pair.

(show public key equation)

private key = generator multiplier (this is an integer)
public key = generated point (this is a point, so has x and y coordinates)

Some intersting things arise from this arrangement:
  - If the private key is very large, it's easy to compute the public key using the divide and conquer method, but very difficult for an attacker to brute force.
  - Unlike the public key, the private key is just a number.  We're able to perform "normal" math operations on it to build out or digital signature system (we can easily divide, easily multiply, etc.)

The Digital Signature Algorithm

A signature must do 2 things:
  - prove that the signer did the signing
  - prove that the thing the signer signed hasn't changed since the signer signed it

The Signature
  
The big idea:
  0.  We have a signer (who possesses a private key), a verifier (who possesses the signer's public key), and a message
  1.  The signer randomly generates a new point, keeping this point's generator multiplier secret
  2.  Division lets the signer create a special pathway to this new point by way of the public key and incorporating the message hash.
  3.  The actual signature contains the "verification" point, and a "special pathway helper" number.
  4.  A verifier, using the special pathway helper, the signer's public key, and the hash of the message, is able to generates the "verification point" and see that it matches what was sent in the 

Now, let's go through an example:

Bitcoin Application

And an example with real numbers on the bitcoin curve:





Unlike

// TODO include equations after graphs
// small note on inifinity in group addition
// describe the digital signature algorithm
// every graph has "graph info"
// remove modulus mathematics explanation (link to wikipedia if people want to learn more)

// highlight KEY IDEAS:
  // - an elliptic curve is nothing more than: Point = Multiplier * Public Generator Point
  // - private key is multiplier, public key is point
  // - given the point, it's impossible to get the multiplier
  // - can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with the multiplier (private key); can only do addition and multiplication with the point (public key)
  // - creating a signature requires division (needs the private key), but verifying the signature only needs addition and multiplication (public key)
